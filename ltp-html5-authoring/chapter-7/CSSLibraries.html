						<strong>A-10</strong>
						<br>
						The Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II is a single-seat, twin turbofan engine, straight wing 
						jet aircraft developed by Fairchild-Republic for the United States Air Force (USAF). It is commonly 
						referred to by the nicknames "Warthog" or "Hog", although the A-10's official name comes from the 
						Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, a World War II fighter-bomber effective at attacking ground targets.[5] 
						The A-10 was designed for close air support (CAS) of friendly ground troops, attacking armored 
						vehicles and tanks, and providing quick-action support against enemy ground forces. It entered 
						service in 1976 and is the only production-built aircraft that has served in the USAF that was 
						designed solely for CAS. Its secondary mission is to provide forward air controller â€“ airborne 
						support, by directing other aircraft in attacks on ground targets. Aircraft used primarily in this 
						role are designated OA-10

						<strong>B-1</strong>
						<br>
						The Rockwell B-1 Lancer[N 1] is a supersonic variable-sweep wing, heavy bomber used by 
						the United States Air Force. It is commonly called the "Bone" (from "B-One"). It is one 
						of three strategic bombers in the U.S. Air Force fleet as of 2020, the other two being 
						the B-2 Spirit and the B-52 Stratofortress.

						<strong>F-22</strong>
						<br>
						The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, 
						all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the United States Air 
						Force (USAF). The result of the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, the 
						aircraft was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter, but also has ground 
						attack, electronic warfare, and signal intelligence capabilities.[4] The prime 
						contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22's airframe and weapons systems 
						and conducted final assembly, while Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics 
						integration, and training systems.
