		<h3>New York City</h3>
		<p>One of my favorite places to go is New York City.  If you want adventure,
		this is the place!  You can easily get your fill of excitement with many options.
		There's a multitude of music venues, museums, parks, stores and much, much more! 
		Here I will mention a few attractions at Hudson Yards.</p>
		<h2>The Vessel</h2>
		<p><a href=https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/discover/vessel>The Vessel</a> is a building
		and an artwork.  It resembles a honeycomb lattice which is just lots of steps.  You walk
		around, up and down and see great views.  The only catch is reservations are required.
		The good news is the tickets are free!</p>
		<h2>The High Line</h2>
		<p><a href=https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/the-high-line>The High Line</a> while not
		technically part of Hudson Yards, it has two entrances over in that area and I wish to
		include it.  It is an "L" (elevated train) that was converted to a park.  It provides
		good views of the Hudson River, many interesting peices of art displayed in the park and
		on various buildings along the way.  There are also some cool buildings viewable on the
		trail.  Plus there's the horizontal waterfall!</p>
		<h2>The Shed</h2>
		<p><a href=https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/discover/shed>The Shed</a> is a building
		designed to host events.  It can transform in a number of ways.  I have yet to attend an
		event here, so I have something to look forward to!</p>
